# Standalone ytv2 Repository

A separate Git repository has been created at:

- `/workspace/ytv2`

It includes:

- `index.html` (copied from `ytv2/index.html` in this repository)
- an initialized Git history with an initial commit on `main`

To push it to GitHub, run these commands from `/workspace/ytv2`:

```bash
git remote add origin <your-github-repo-url>
git push -u origin main
```
